Executive Summary

Sergio (CEO) has separated the engagement into two distinct deliverables: a motivational workshop for the general staff and a high-level strategic implementation for the management team. His primary directive is operational efficiency without headcount growth ("Empower one person to do the work of ten"). He requires a "shock and awe" approach for the staff to drive adoption, while the management salespoints and views must focus strictly on financial ROI (cost/time savings) rather than technical features.

Key Operational Pain Points Identified:

Accounts Payable: Invoices arrive late and are difficult to match to specific projects/inverters, causing cost allocation issues.

Sales: Field teams provide unreliable activity reports ("casaca"). Sergio wants to move from unverifiable claims to verified data.

Finance: Processes are highly manual and reactive. The goal is to automate compliance and avoid audit risks.

Next Steps & Action Items

Deliverable A: Management Strategy Presentation

Audience: Sergio, Luis & Julián (Operations), Flor (Finance), Isabel (Commercial), and the Assistant.

Requirement: Quantifiable ROI. You must present a "Before vs. After" comparison showing specific time/money savings.

Tone: "Cold numbers." If it costs X, it must save Y. No "nice to have" features.

Deliverable B: Staff Workshop (2 Hours)

Audience: "Green en pleno" (All staff).

Format: In-person, likely a breakfast or lunch at a restaurant.

Structure:

Part 1: Intro & Demystification ("What exists?").

Part 2: Hands-on implementation ("What can I use today?").

High-ROI AI Opportunities (For Management Deck)
Based on Sergio’s specific friction points, these are the 3 highest-value implementations to pitch:

1. The "Truth" Engine for Sales (Voice-to-Data)

Problem: Salespeople claiming they worked when they were at the sauna; manual reporting is friction-heavy.

AI Solution: Equip sales reps with a voice-first agent. They dictate their visit summary immediately after leaving the client.

ROI: 100% data capture accuracy + GPS verification stamp. Eliminates "I forgot to type it up" excuses.

2. Automated Invoice Intelligence (AP Logic)

Problem: "Cuentas por pagar" nightmare—unable to allocate material costs (inverters) to specific projects due to messy/late vendor invoices.

AI Solution: An AI agent that ingests PDF invoices/photos, extracts line items, and cross-references them against open Project POs to suggest the correct cost code automatically.

ROI: Reduces processing time from days to seconds; enables real-time project profitability tracking.

3. The "Auditor Shield" (Finance)

Problem: Flor is doing manual entry and fears audit discrepancies.

AI Solution: Anomaly detection agent. It scans ledgers against receipts to flag inconsistencies before the external audit happens.

ROI: Risk mitigation and zero overtime during tax season.
